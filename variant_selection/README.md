# Variant selection

## Downloading data on PTEN from the AlphaMissense website and identify 12 variants dispersed equally throughout the protein structure. 

### Go to the AlphaMissense website 
[AlphaMissense search module]{https://alphamissense.hegelab.org/search}

### Search for PTEN with default settings and download the resulting dataset. 
### Open the .csv file in your favorite browser and identify 12 different locations with interest in the protein (compare with the visualisation of the chosen structure, for example shown with PyMOL)
### Find variants within these regions with an interesting AlphaMissense class (pathogenic, likely_pathogenic, ambiguous, and likely benign) and score. 
### Choose variants which are benchmarked with experimental data from cBioPortal, ClinVar or Cosmic, identified with CancerMuts.
