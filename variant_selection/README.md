# Variant selection

## Downloading data on PTEN from the AlphaMissense website and identify 12 variants dispersed equally throughout the protein structure. 

### Go to the AlphaMissense website 
[AlphaMissense search module]{https://alphamissense.hegelab.org/search}

### Search for PTEN with default settings and download the resulting dataset. 
### Open the .csv file in your favorite browser and identify 12 different locations with interest in the protein (compare with the visualisation of the chosen structure, for example shown with PyMOL)
### Find variants within these regions with an interesting AlphaMissense class (pathogenic, likely_pathogenic, ambiguous, and likely benign) and score. 
### Choose variants which are benchmarked with experimental data from cBioPortal, ClinVar or Cosmic, identified with CancerMuts and further examined in the online webserver of each databse.
### Cancermuts website
[Cancermuts website]{https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/cancermuts/Cancermuts_database}
#### Choose "Add filter", then "GENE" and then write "PTEN". Download the dataset and look in the column "source" to identify the database containing external data on each variation of interest. 

### cBioPortal website
{https://www.cbioportal.org/}
#### In "Quick search" search for "PTEN" as GENE and choose the subpage "Mutations". Then search for the residue number identified in Cancermuts and AlphaMissense.

### ClinVar website
{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/} 
#### Search for "PTEN" as GENE and look through the list of variations. Click on the variation of interesting and read about external classifications. 

### COSMIC website
{https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/login}
#### Create a profil/log into the database. Search for "PTEN" as GENE and look through variations.
